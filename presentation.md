## Why should you trust me?
</grid>
<grid drag="100 80" drop="center">
1) You shouldn't trust me
2) Bought my first printer, a Printrbot simple metal, in June 2014. Have been printing since then.
3) Run a print farm of 13 printers
4) Have helped many creators across the world with making 3d printing more accessible to them
5) No seriously, don't trust me. Research what is best for you and your needs

+ Sculpt on your device, make changes, or revert with ease even years later
+ You can make rapid iterations on an idea you have
+ You can print out many of the same thing or with slight variations
+ Variety of materials with different properties you can utilize

![](images/print_failure.jpg)

<grid drag="100 50" drop="left">
+ The process is not food safe
+ The process can produce waste that can't be recycled normally

+ Layer and extrusion lines may be undesired and post processing may be needed

## Types of printers in this talk
</grid>
<grid drag="100 70" drop="center">
### SLA
Uses liquid resin and a UV laser or light to cure the resin. It peels the resin off of a film, lifts the bed away form the film and repeats.
### FDM
Uses filament, gears feed the filament into a hot end which melts it. It lays down layers one after another to build up the structure.
</grid>

---
<grid drag="100 20" drop="top">
## SLA - Good things
</grid>
<grid drag="20 100" drop="left">
![](personal_images/sla-timelapse.gif)
</grid>
<grid drag="75 100" drop="-1 5">
- Great detail and you can print very small objects
- Number of objects don't matter, print time is determined by height of the tallest object and chosen layer height 
	- 1 copy of an object or 30 copies of the object, the time is the same!
- You can use a clear base resin and color the resin while in your tank, easily creating your own colors!
- You can add glitter or other materials to your resin to add additional properties, textures, or colors.
</grid>
---
## SLA Downsides
+ Printers can usually only print smaller objects
+ Resin has a relatively short shelf life of a few months to a year or so. If you don't use it before it expires, it won't print well and you can't regenerate it
+ Yellows quite quickly (sometimes while curing!) unless painted and protected from additional UV
+ A lot of reins warp easily and tends not to be accurate enough if you're looking for tight fits
---
## SLA Downsides
+ Messy and wasteful
	- You will need extra chemicals
	- You are dealing with liquids, spills will happen
	- You will need disposable gloves, respirators, and more as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
+ You must post process the parts you print after the printer is done.
	- Washing in IPA or another chemical that will help clean extra resin off of the part
	- Curing to full hardness by shining a lot more UV light onto the part
---
## SLA Toxicity
- Uncured resin is ***==toxic==*** . Read the MSDS!
	- Wear PPE if you are going to be in the same room as it when uncured for example while printing. Ideally you want to vent the printer outside to avoid the toxic fumes
	- Wear PPE when handling parts that have not been fully cured
	- Do not throw away any contaminated gloves, paper towels, IPA, or anything that has come in contact with the uncured resin until you've used UV light or sunlight to fully cure it
	- **==Do not wash or allow any uncured resin down your sink, into any waterways, or into your local environment!==**

---
## Dattas' SLA Recommendations
- Great for miniatures, if you're into Warhammer, D&D or other games where miniatures are used, this could be what you're looking for
- Great detail especially for smaller objects
- Very wasteful and messy
- Not fun to post process and you must post process
- Not fun to properly dispose or care of the toxic waste
- Due to possibly not being able to fully cure the middle of parts, resin printed parts are risky to use on anything that will be worn. Because of this it is not recommend for fursuit parts!

<grid drag="100 20" drop="top">
## FDM
</grid>
<grid drag="20 100" drop="left">
![](personal_images/fdm.gif)
</grid>
<grid drag="75 100" drop="-1 5">
Pros:
- Tons of different materials with tons of different properties
- You can get very accurate parts
- More common than SLA

Cons:
- If you have more parts, it will take more time to print
- Slower and less detailed than Resin printing
- Layer lines and extrusions more noticeable 
</grid>

## Types of Filament
- PLA & PLA+
- PETG
- ABS
- PVB
- TPU/TPE
- More!
---
<grid drag="100 10" drop="top">
## PLA & PLA+
</grid>
<grid drag="100 85" drop="center" align="left">
- PLA is made from corn!
- Recommended uses: 
  - Figurines, prototypes, quick tests
- Upsides:
  - Cheap
  - Easiest thermoplastic to print
  - Comes in the most colors of any filament 
- Downsides:
  + Brittle
  + Deforms under mild heat or pressure
  + Creeps over time
  + PLA+ is not an established formula and will vary wildly
</grid>
---
<grid drag="100 10" drop="top">
## PETG
</grid>
<grid drag="100 80" drop="center" align="left">
- The material single use water and soda bottles are made from, with a slight modifier to make it easier to print
- Recommended uses: 
  - Functional parts, prototypes, quick tests
- Upsides:
  - Cheap
  - Relatively easy to print
  - Comes in quite a few colors
- Downsides:
  + More stringy than some others if not fully dry
</grid>
---
<grid drag="100 10" drop="top">
## ABS & ASA
</grid>
<grid drag="100 85" drop="center" align="left">
- The most popular engineering grade thermoplastic in the world
- Recommended uses:
  - Functional parts, long lasting parts, prototypes
- Upsides:
  - Cheap & Very heat resistant
  - You can smooth layer lines with Acetone vapors
  - ASA is also UV resistant
- Downsides:
  + Releases VOCs while printing and smells bad while printing
  + Needs a heated chamber
  + Warps easily
  + Shrinks more than other thermoplastics!
</grid>
---
<grid drag="100 10" drop="top">
## PVB
</grid>
<grid drag="80 70" drop="right" align="right">
![](images/pvb.png)
</grid>
<grid drag="70 80" drop="left" align="left">
- Smooths layer lines when introduced to IPA
- Recommended uses:
  - Mold making or if you want to hide layer lines
- Upsides:
  - Easy to print
  - Removing layer lines and extrusion lines becomes much easier
- Downsides:
  + Expensive
  + Can't clean with IPA without it getting soft
</grid>
---
<grid drag="100 10" drop="top">
## TPU/TPE
</grid>
<grid drag="100 85" drop="0 5" align="left">
- Flexible plastic! 
- Upsides:
  - Very strong and durable
  - Can be cut with sharp scissors or utility knives after printing
  - Returns to shape after deformed
- Downsides:
  + Expensive
  + Difficult to print, basically impossible if you have a bowden printer.
  + Very stringy, even if tuned properly and dry
  + Might not be able to support it's own weight if it doesn't have enough infill or walls
